# Google Hashcode 2018 -*Ride*-
#### A Simple solution for the 2018 Hash Code problem
Our solution was to loop for every car and select a ride with largest distance between its first and last point (sorting rides)
until we reach the number of the given steps or finishing all rides.
Then we store that taken rides in frequency array in order not to be taken by another car.<br>
Of course it is not a very good solution but it It worked somewhat :) .
